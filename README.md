## Tempo

Tempo Web is the frontend of [Tempo](https://github.com/tempo-co/tempo-api): a private personal-finance overview for connected bank accounts. Built with React 19, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, and TanStack Router/Query; end-to-end tested with Playwright.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have the following installed on your system:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (22.x)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) (for the E2E stack)

## Installation

```bash
$ npm ci
```

## Env setup

Vite environment values are declared in `vite-env.d.ts`:

- `VITE_API_URL`: API base URL used by `src/utils/api.ts`
- `VITE_APP_URL`: app URL used by Playwright's web server and `baseURL`
- `VITE_EMAIL_UI_URL`: Mailpit URL used by `test/utils/email-utils.ts`
- `VITE_BASE_PATH` (optional, default `/`): base path the app and PWA manifest are served under

The app must be served over HTTPS or from `localhost`. It coordinates logout across tabs with the Web Locks API, which browsers withhold from other plain HTTP origins; there it shows a "Tempo needs a secure connection" screen instead of starting.

## Development

```bash
$ npm run dev
```

Generates the TanStack route tree and starts Vite with hot reload.

## Build

```bash
$ npm run build
```

Generates routes, type-checks with `tsc -b`, and produces the production bundle. Lint and format checks mirror CI:

```bash
$ npm run lint:check
$ npm run format:check
```

## Test

End-to-end tests use Playwright against a disposable Docker stack (PostgreSQL, Redis, Mailpit, and the API). Playwright builds and previews the app itself.

For a fully deterministic local run (reset services, fresh database and seed):

```bash
$ npm run test:e2e:local
```

This uses `ghcr.io/tempo-co/tempo-api:main`. To test against an unmerged API change, set `TEMPO_API_E2E_IMAGE` to a locally built image or a PR image (`ghcr.io/tempo-co/tempo-api:pr-<n>`).

CI runs the same suite on every pull request and on `main` (`npx playwright test` against fresh services). A web PR whose body contains `Depends-on: tempo-api#<n>` runs against that API PR's image.

`docker:test:up` / `docker:test:down` manage the E2E services; each E2E run starts from a pristine database, and the E2E setup authenticates seeded users via `test/auth.setup.ts`.
